The following files are the most likely candidates that will need to be edited or added to satisfy your requests:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – to update the app title and description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – to generate a new app logo.  
3. **guessing_game.py** – a new Python script that implements the random‑number‑guessing game.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks (or new‑file blocks) for them.
